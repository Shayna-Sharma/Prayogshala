Project Name:
                  PRAYOGSHALA
      VIRTUAL LABS : Revolutionizing Education
 
#Description:
PRAYOGSHALA is an interactive virtual lab that allows users to experience the experiments virtually.
It aims to revolutionize education by making experiments safe, interactive and accessible.

#Introduction:
Explore, experiment, and learn with our cutting-edge virtual labs, designed to bring science to life like never before. No expensive equipment, no safety risksâ€”just hands-on learning anytime, anywhere.
In this, experiment simulators allow students to conduct virtual science experiments. These simulators use AI to create realistic, interactive, and adaptive learning experiences.

#Features:
-Visualization of experiments.
-Includes topic-based segregated data.
-AI regulated simulators.
-Provides all possible solutions for a problem. 
-Helps to explore what-if scenarios.

#Tech Stack:
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Backend: Node.js, Flask
-API Integration: AI powered prompt system
-Database: MySQL

#Working:
-It has three laboratories Chemistry, Biology and Physics.
-API is trained in such a way that it gives multiple experiments as option to the users to choose from, 
 once the user chooses an experiment it searches for the result in the database and gives the not only the result
 but also explains every process and gives reasons.
-In  Chemistry Laboratory it takes user input from the multiple symbolic names of the reactants in chemical reactions, formula based calculations in physics  and major processes in biology .
 It simulates the input data and provides an efficient output like products of the chemical reactions and the reason for the reaction.
-In Physics Laboratory it takes user input from the multiple experiment option it gives and takes in the measurements required as input.
 Gives the result based on the measurements and explains the working.
- In Biology Laboratory it takes user input from the multiple experiment and asks for needed input and gives the result of experiment.

#Installation and Setup:
-It is a web app, that does not require any installation thus making it easily accessible.
-The only setup needed for it is a browsing app.

#Usage:
-Can be used by school and college students to perform experiments for free.
-Students can learn alot by thinking out of the box and doing the experiment in any way they want.
